bgpy

This is a python package.  It should work seamlessly with both standard CPython 
and IronPython.

System setup and dependencies: 
-  create an environment variable BGPY_DATADIR pointing to the directory 
   where bgpy will find data files (spreadsheets, flat files, sqlite  
   databases--not MySQL databases)
   BGPY_DATADIR does not have to be on PATH, PYTHONPATH or IRONPYTHONPATH
   (defaults to HOMEPATH if not defined
-  bgpy requires the modules xlrd and xlwt for manipulating *.xls files
   on Windows/IronPython make sure these are not installed as eggs (i.e.,
   don't use easy_install, install from source or use the Windows installer in 
   the Cheese Shop.)
-  QuantLib should be installed for IronPython and Python (C# and C++ bindings 
   respectively) in directories that are not on PATH or PYTHONPATH and defined
   in environment variables PYONLY and IPYONLY.
